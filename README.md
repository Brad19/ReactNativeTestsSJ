# ReactNativeTestsSJ
The Objective is to create a 2 screens in React native where the first page should display the list of matching jobs for the selected worker. And upon selecting the job, it
should take the user to job details screen.

#### Setup
- Download the repo
- yarn install
- cd ios & pod install
- yarn ios (I've verified in iPhone 11 - 14.3)

#### Test
- yarn test

#### Challenges
- There was no specification in terms of UI available to list down the matching jobs for screen1.
- Could not exactly match the heading title as it looks like an image with green and red dots on top of swipejobs.
- Data does not hold information about the Shift end dates.

#### Addition:
- In addition to do the matching jobs in the first page, i took liberty in completing the job details page as well.
- Given more time, I could have done more tests.
